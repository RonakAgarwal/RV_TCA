# Red Ventures technical Case Assessment

## Question 1 
### Which variables are the most helpful in understanding if a customer is going to be approved or denied for a loan? Are there certain variables that are not useful to collect?

Grouping the data to assess first the numerical then the categorical and ordinal associated variables, it is clear that some variables hold a correlation with approval rate, whereas some variables do not hold such a correlation. Of the variables: FICO Score, FICO Score Category, Monthly Gross Income, Employment Status, and Ever Bankrupt/Foreclose have a strong correlation with the approval rate of the loan. On the other hand, the variables: Loan Amount, Monthly Housing Payment, Employment Sector, and Reason do not have any noticeable correlation with the approval rate of the loan.
